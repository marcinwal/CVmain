# Marcin Walendzik 


I love science, technologies and programming. I can learn and use new technologies which I proved during my 12 weeks MakecrsAcadmy course. I used to solve many problems before my course and worked in extremly stressful environemnt running different kind of risk and responsibilities.

I would like to work in organisation full of energetic people who are happy to explore, test and deliver new technological solutions.


## Skills

### Work in stressful environment

I worked in finance for the last few years running some substantial risk positions in much less friendly organisational framworks compared to developers world which I love. I was responsible for a team of 5-8 people I worked in challenging environment and delivered given goals. I was responisble for Emerging Markets trading unit(Fixed Income and FX).

### Ruby

I learned Ruby during MA course, its OOP structure and some subjects which were brand new to me;
especially I liked metaprogramming which opens new possibilities.

### Javascript

I did my final projects (with my colleagues) in js.
It was a full stack js application using Cordvoa (js framework for mobile applications), node.js and spotify API.
I managed to create an android app which was using its connection to Beacon to trigger some other actions on the server side and Spotify.
We did it in just 10 days.

### TDD,BDD

I learned a lot about test driven development during my course which also a totally new concept to me and I know how to use different testing tools during programming process.

### Python

I played with my RaspberryPi and planning to do more in the future. I took some online courses and I will dive in even more as I like AI, ML which seem to be well supported in python.

### C,C++

I used to program in C and C++ during my studies which I am sure need to be refreshed but I love the concept of using small devices like arduino which I can program on my own.
